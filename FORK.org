* Motivation

The more I dig into Interim, the hackier it seems to me.  A fork or a
rewrite stealing its concepts might be worthwhile, but even more
time-consuming than improving Interim.

* Languages

- Suck it up and write better C
- C++ / Rust / Ada (more complicated than C)
- D (you'd need to port most of the stdlib)
- Forth (write an interpreter in ARM assembly, then implement Lisp on
  top of that?)
- Pascal (seems rather verbose and not as featureful as C)

* Cheating

There are projects for spitting out an executable that can run on bare
metal with an useful stdlib.  That approach would allow concentrating
on the interesting bits:

- MirageOS: https://mirage.io/
- Ultibo: https://github.com/pik33/ultibo-retromachine

Downside of this approach is that you forego hosted mode.
